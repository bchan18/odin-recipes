    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ pound peeled, matchstick-cut fresh ginger</li>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) catfish fillets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ red bell pepper, cut into thin matchsticks</li>
        <li>½ bunch green onions, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ginger in the hot oil until slightly softened and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add catfish fillets; cook until firm, about 3 minutes per side. Remove fillets from the skillet to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir fish sauce, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in the skillet. Add onion and red bell pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Return catfish fillets to the skillet and spoon sauce and vegetables over the fillets. Continue cooking until the flesh of the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more. Garnish with green onions to serve.</li>
